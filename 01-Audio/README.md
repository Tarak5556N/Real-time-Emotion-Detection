# Speech Emotion Recognition
This project recognizes emotions like happy, sad, or angry from audio recordings. It uses the RAVDESS dataset with 24 actors speaking and singing in different emotional tones. I trained two models: a basic SVM with audio features and a CNN-LSTM with log-mel-spectrograms. The CNN-LSTM model works better, scoring 76.6% accuracy. Youâ€™ll need Python and some libraries like Tensorflow and Librosa to run it.
